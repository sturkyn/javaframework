# *Welcome to the SCG's Automation Project*
## This test framework consists of:
### Software Language: **Java**
### Automation Library: **Selenium**
### Package Manager: **Maven**
### Runner: **TestNG**
### API Testing: **RestAssured**
### Reporting Tools: **Allure Reports**

## Use following command to run the desired test suite:
## `mvn clean test -Dsuites={test_suite_name} -Dapp`

### Change the browser version to your local version at BaseDriver.java line 46!

*You can work on the project with Windows/Mac/Linux systems.*
## Installation
### Mac / Linux based systems

Install homebrew via just pasting below line on terminal:

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

* Install Selenium via Homebrew (use Mac terminal):
  `brew install selenium-server`

  `brew install allure`
* Download Xcode from App Store (This will enable Git on your Macbook)
* Clone the  [javaframework](https://github.com/sturkyn/javaframework) repository.
* Open the project on your IDE and let maven build scripts work to download all dependencies.

### Windows PC

Some additional steps are required to run the code on Windows PC.

* Download [maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* Copy the folder under *C:\\Program Files*
* Download [allure reports](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/qameta/allure/allure-commandline/)
* Extract allure commandline zip to "allure-commandline" folder
* On the Windows taskbar, right-click the Windows icon and select System.
* In the Settings window, under Related Settings, click Advanced system settings.
* On the Advanced tab, click Environment Variables.
* Click New to create a new environment variable.
* Add environment variable JAVA_HOME: *In example: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_121`*
* Add environment variable for Maven as M2: `%M2_HOME%\bin`
* Add environment variable for Maven as M2_HOME: *In example: `C:\Program Files\apache-maven-3.8.6`*
* Add Path variable for Maven: *In example: `C:\Program Files\apache-maven-3.8.6\bin`*
* Add Path variable for Allure Reports: *In example  `C:\allure-commandline\allure-2.10.0\bin`*

For adding new dependencies to the project, visit [mvn repository](https://mvnrepository.com/) and add them under <Dependencies> tag of pom.xml

_You can find test suites under src/test/suites and add the relevant suite name to the command line code._
_You can find linter rules under /checkstyle.xml
